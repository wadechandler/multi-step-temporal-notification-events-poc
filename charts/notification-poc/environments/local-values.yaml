# KIND-specific overrides — lower resource limits and scaling thresholds.
# Infrastructure addresses (kafka, temporal, prometheus) are inherited from
# values.yaml; only component-specific tunables need overriding here.
#
# Usage: helm install ... -f charts/notification-poc/environments/local-values.yaml
